PAGE COMPONENTS

Components that appear on nearly every page, such as breadcrumbs or menus. Components should only be placed here if they are unique, and not considerred overrides of global styles. For example, a block containing an H2 tag that gets replaced by the logo. You could consider this an override of the default h2 styles within the context of the of this specific block, but it makes more sense to consider this a completely separate global element, with no relationship to the default h2 styling.

On the other hand, a block of links in the sidebar should probably inherit all the default block styles, so any unique styling for this block should be defined in contextual/_blocks.less. Even if this block appears on every page, it should still be considerred a contextual element.

There is considerable gray area between what is a global page componenet and what is just a block context, so use your best judgment.
