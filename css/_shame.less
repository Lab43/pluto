HACKS & TEMPERORARY FIXES

See http://csswizardry.com/2013/04/shame-css/ for a fuller description of this file.

If something is a quick fix or hack, put it in _shame.less. This helps us keep track of these problems, so that they can be fixed later, and so that other css files don't become bloated and unorganized. It's important that everything in _shame.less is very well documented.
